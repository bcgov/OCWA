# OCWA Form API

OCWA has not created a form API. We instead leverage an existing software designed to provide flexible forms / validation.

## Components

- Formio (<https://form.io/>)

### Service (Formio)

Formio is a seperate service available from the repository below. It is expected that you download that repo and have an image hosted somewhere

Note: We had to modify the dockerfile to get it to build so that modified dockerfile is available in this folder.
