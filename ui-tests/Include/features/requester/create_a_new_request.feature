Feature: create a new request
	As an requester I want to be able to submit my output (and associated metadata) for review so that I can start the process of getting my outputs out of the secure environment
	Background:
		Given requester has logged in
		And requester initiates a new request
		And the requester affirms the output is safe for release and protects the confidentiality of data, to the best of the authorized userï¿½s knowledge
	Scenario: A valid request
		Given the export files do not violate any blocking rules
		When requester submits their request 
		Then the requester's request is put in awaiting review
